   *
   * Objects that are taken out of a container will take one or more frames to spawn.
   * Certain interactions (e.g. physics) will not be able to take place until the object has finished spawning.
   *
   * @param parameters A Table of parameters used to determine how takeObject will act.
   *
   * @important
   * Certain containers only exist whilst they have more than one object contained within them (e.g. decks).
   * Once you remove the second last object from a container, the container will be destroyed and the remaining contained object will spawn in its place.
   * After calling `takeObject` you can check for a remainder.
   *
   * @example
   * Take an object out of a container.
   * As we take it out we'll instruct the object to smooth move (default positioning behavior) to coordinates (0, 5, 0).
   * Additionally, we're going to add a blue highlight on the object we've taken out.
   *
   * ```lua
   * local takenObject = container.takeObject({
   *     position = {x = 0, y = 5, z = 0},
   * })
   * takenObject.highlightOn('Blue')
   * ```lua
   *
   * @example Advanced example
   * Take an object out of a container, and then apply an upward force (impulse) shooting it into the air.
   * We can only apply an impulse to an object once its (underlying rigid body) has finished spawning.
   * Additionally, freshly spawned objects are frozen in place for a single frame.
   * So we need to wait for the taken object to finish spawning (i.e. callback_function) then wait one more frame before applying the impulse.
   *
   * ```lua
   * container.takeObject({
   *     callback_function = function(spawnedObject)
   *         Wait.frames(function()
   *             -- We've just waited a frame, which has given the object time to unfreeze.
   *             -- However, it's also given the object time to enter another container, if
   *             -- it spawned on one. Thus, we must confirm the object is not destroyed.
   *             if not spawnedObject.isDestroyed() then
   *                 spawnedObject.addForce({0, 30, 0})
   *             end
   *         end)
   *     end,
   *     smooth = false, -- Smooth moving objects cannot have forces applied to them.
   * })
